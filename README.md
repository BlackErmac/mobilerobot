My expertise lies in the design and development of a mobile robot controller for path planning and following a predefined trajectory. This involves utilizing a combination of a PID controller, a fuzzy controller, and integrating them into a FUZZY-PID controller. Furthermore, I focus on optimizing the membership functions of the FUZZY-PID controller using a genetic optimization algorithm.

The primary objective of this project is to create a robust and efficient controller that enables the mobile robot to navigate along a predefined path accurately. The PID controller provides a fundamental control mechanism that can be fine-tuned to achieve desired performance by adjusting its proportional, integral, and derivative gains. The fuzzy controller, on the other hand, introduces a more flexible and adaptive control paradigm, allowing for better handling of uncertain or nonlinear dynamics.

By integrating the PID and fuzzy controllers into a FUZZY-PID controller, we can harness the strengths of both approaches, leveraging the precise control of the PID controller and the adaptability of the fuzzy controller. This integration aims to enhance the overall control performance and improve the robot's ability to follow the desired path accurately.

To further optimize the performance of the FUZZY-PID controller, I employ a genetic optimization algorithm. This algorithm iteratively searches for optimal parameter combinations by simulating the evolution of a population of potential solutions. By evaluating the fitness of each solution based on predefined criteria, the algorithm refines the parameters of the membership functions, ultimately improving the controller's performance.

Through this comprehensive approach of combining PID and fuzzy control techniques and optimizing them using a genetic optimization algorithm, I strive to develop an advanced and efficient controller for mobile robots, enabling precise path planning and accurate trajectory tracking.

In the following, we will compare different methods
